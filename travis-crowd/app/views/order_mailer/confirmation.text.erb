You have just ordered the "<%= order.package.name %>" <%= order.subscription? ? 'subscription' : 'package' %>
which means you have donated <%= number_to_currency order.total_in_dollars %> to Travis CI.

This amount has been charged on your credit card and you should have received a confirmation from Stripe.

<% unless order.package.id == :nano %>
  Included in this <%= order.subscription? ? 'subscription' : 'package' %> are the following features:
  <%= render partial: "order_mailer/features/#{order.package.id}" %>
