    %em= number_to_currency(results[:total])
    in total.
    This puts a huge :D on our face. We love you folks.

  %h2.ribbon Please donate!
  %p
    We figured donating to a fun project should be more fun than just fun. So we <i>made</i> it fun :)
  %p
    %strong What you will get?
    We've got some
    %a{href: '#stickers'} awesome stickers
    hot off the press as well as a bunch of
    %a{href: '#ringtones'} ringtones and sounds
    from  Yehuda, Aaron, Jose and Jon. And how about a virtual cup of tea with Josh and Sven on Skype or
    even a one hour remote pairing session with one of our fantastic volunteers<sup>1</sup>!
  %p
    %strong What we'll use the money for?
    We are going to make Travis CI better (see <a href="#future-plans">some of the features</a> we have in the pipeline) and
    we are going to build Travis CI pro<sup>2</sup>.

        "Travis CI pro" is the working title for the hosted service for private builds
        that we are going to provide as soon as possible (and which we have founded a
        company for, see the [FAQ](#faq-who-are-you) for more info. We will book credits
        for your future account if you donate one of the bigger packages.
