# Community cookbooks

These are vendored community cookbooks that **do not belong to Travis CI**,
although modifications *may* have been made at some point.  Ideally, these
cookbooks are not mutated, and maybe someday they won't even need to be
vendored, yay!

## Re-vendoring effort

The following packages have been re-vendored at the versions already present in
this directory.  Dependency cookbooks were also installed, and some were not
available on the supermarket.

```
ant  
apt  
ark  
build-essential  
erlang  
git  
iptables  
jpackage  
leiningen  
libevent  
maven  
memcached  
ntp  
openssl  
opsmatic  
packagecloud  
php  
rabbitmq  
rsyslog  
runit  
rvm  
timezone  
vim  
```
