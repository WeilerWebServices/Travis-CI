# Travis Styleguide

This is a node thing, so you need to have node and npm installed.

To check if you have node installed, run:
```$ node --version```  
It should output something like `v0.10.36` or something. Does it? Cool!  

If not (and on a mac) run:  
```$ brew install node```  
This should install node and the node package manager, npm.  

Moving on  
```$ git clone git@github.com:travis-ci/travis-styleguide.git && cd travis-styleguide```
and then  
```$ npm install```  
and you're done with installation!  

And to just run this to start the development server:  
```$ gulp --dev```  

## Deployment

Travis takes care of deploying the styleguide once a build passes. Time to party \o/
