There are some news to share about Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC), the open source scholarship program we've organized together with the community for the last 6 years: RGSoC will get a new name. The organization team has been thinking about rebranding for 2 years already, and started working on it – alongside running the program — last year.  
This year, the team will take some time to plan and complete the rebranding of RGSoC. Read about how and why on the RGSoC blog: [The Future of RGSoC](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2019-03-21-the-future-of-rgsoc).
