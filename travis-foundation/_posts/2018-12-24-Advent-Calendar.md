As a surprise for all our friends and followers we created an [Advent Calendar on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tfadventcalendar?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash). Every day we tweeted recommendations of what was good this year regarding feminism, diversity or open source. We got way, way more recommendations from friends & family of the Foundation than we could include (we definitely need a longer advent calendar!), so here we are sharing all whooping 74 recommendations with you — Happy Holidays!
